// intermediate
// 1.Class Design:
// Design a UfoSighting class that represents a single UFO 
// sighting. What attributes and methods would you include?

// 2.Encapsulation:
// How would you ensure that the Explanation field is only
// modifiable through a specific method in the UfoSighting class?

// 3.Inheritance:
// Suppose you need to track different types of sightings, 
// such as ConfirmedUfoSighting and DebunkedUfoSighting. 
// How would you design an inheritance hierarchy to 
// differentiate between these cases?

// 4.Polymorphism:
// Implement a method describe_sighting() in the UfoSighting 
// class that returns a string summary. Then, override it in 
// ConfirmedUfoSighting and DebunkedUfoSighting to provide 
// different descriptions based on the explanation field.

// 5.Abstraction:
// Define an abstract class Sighting with an abstract method 
// get_details(), and implement it in UfoSighting. What fields 
// should be included in get_details()?

// 6.Association & Composition:
// Create a UfoReport class that contains multiple UfoSighting 
// objects. How would you implement methods to add, remove, and filter sightings?

// 7.Encapsulation & Validation:
// Modify the UfoSighting class so that the Occurred field 
// must follow a strict datetime format. How would you implement this validation in a setter method?

// 8.Static Methods & Class Variables:
// Implement a class variable in UfoSighting to keep track of 
// the total number of sightings created. Include a static method get_total_sightings() to retrieve the count.

// 9.Data Processing:
// Write a method filter_by_country() in the UfoReport class 
// that returns all sightings from a given country. How would 
// you implement this using object-oriented principles?

// 10.Sorting & Comparisons:
// Implement a method in the UfoSighting class that allows 
// sorting sightings by the Occurred date. 
// How would you define a comparison method to achieve this?
