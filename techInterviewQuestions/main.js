// 1. **Fundamentals**:
//    - **Problem**: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with all the numbers doubled. Use `let` and `const` appropriately in your solution.

// 2. **Functions**:
//    - **Problem**: Create a function that returns another function. The inner function should take a number and return that number multiplied by a factor that was passed to the outer function.

// 3. **Asynchronous JavaScript**:
//    - **Problem**: Write a function that fetches data from a public API (like JSONPlaceholder) and logs the result. Use Promises and then refactor it to use async/await.

// 4. **DOM Manipulation**:
//    - **Problem**: Write a function that takes an ID of an HTML element and changes its background color to blue when clicked. Use event delegation to handle clicks on multiple elements.

// 5. **Object-Oriented Programming**:
//    - **Problem**: Create a simple class called `Car` that has properties for `make`, `model`, and `year`. Include a method that returns a string describing the car (e.g., "2020 Toyota Camry").

// 6. **ES6 Features**:
//    - **Problem**: Write a function that takes an object with properties `firstName` and `lastName`, and returns a string that combines them into a full name using destructuring assignment.

// These problems will help you practice and solidify your understanding of JavaScript concepts. If you want, I can guide you on how to approach solving these problems or suggest resources to help you practice. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific problem or concept?
